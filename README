This project was created as a vehicle to help me learn about networking in kubernetes
A NodePort exposes App A outside of the cluster. Using this, a Http get request is made
which in-turn makes a call to App B to get some data. The communication between App A
and App B is considered pods-to-pod communication and a ClusterIp Service is used
to enable App A to access the port that App B is running on.

The project can be built using the yaml files.
